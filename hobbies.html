      <p>Normally I make the family Sunday dinner. Last week, we had herb encrusted grilled spare ribs with fresh baked rolls.</p>  
      <p>Christmas dinner was Beef Wellington with mash potatoes and gravy. I also made stuffed chicken breasts for my sister and grandma, who are non-red meat eaters.</p>

      <p>I love the snow. Unfortunately, I live in California, so I don't see it until ski season. Playing in the snow is awesome, but if the temperatures were always in the mid-teens or single digits, like Chicago, I probably would never go outside.</p>
      <p>One of my most memorable vacations was going to Hobbiton. The director, Sir Peter Jackson, was so detailed in the creation of "The Shire". This tree is actually fake. It's made out of fiberglass and the leaves are made out of silk, which were attached one by one. If the leaves started to fade, Sir Peter Jackson had them hand painted back to its correct color.</p>

    <p>I have been coding for 3 years. Coding to me is like solving a big jigsaw puzzle, where there's a reward at the end. I'm sharing with you something I coded last year. Also, based on our professor's strict instructions, I am sharing the stripped out version; just the pure html.</p>
